# **Procedure for design of reinforced slab**
1. Launch FreeCAD on your computer.
2. Begin a new project or open an existing project where you want to design the slab reinforcement.
3. Select a BIM Workbench And Set a Top view.
4. Create a 2-point rectangle, for Center Align set (X, Y & Z : 0, 0 & 0).
5. After that Choose a appropriate parameter of  Slab.
6. Create a Slab from a planar Shape.
7. Next select a Reinforcement Workbench and Select a correct face of Slab.
8. Then, Create a Slab Reinforcement from a selected face of the Structural element.
9. Depending on the design requirements, adjust the parameters of the reinforcement such as spacing, diameter, cover, etc.
10. Ensure that the reinforcement configuration meets the design specifications and standards.
11. Inspect the model to ensure that the reinforcement is placed correctly and meets the structural requirements.
12. Save your FreeCAD project to preserve your work and modifications.
