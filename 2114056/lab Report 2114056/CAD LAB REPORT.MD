## Assignment - 5

- **Software Used:** FreeCAD

## Objective: 
To creat the 3D Hut using the FreeCAD

## * Introduction:

Designing and modelling 3D structures is a fundamental aspect of architectural and engineering projects. In this report, we will explore the process of using FreeCAD to design a 3D hut, focusing on techniques for modelling architectural elements such as walls, roof, doors, and windows.

## Materials and Equipments

1.FreeCAD software (latest version)
2.Computer or laptop with required specifications.
3.Architectural and design knowledge and expertise.

## Procedure

**1.Open FreeCAD:** Launch the LibreCAD software on your computer.
**2.Download & install the BIM Workbench:**
- Visit the FreeCAD BIM Workbench repository on GitHub.
-- Follow the installation instructions provided in the README file or on the GitHub page.

- For most operating systems, it typically involves extracting the downloaded files and copying them to the appropriate directory where FreeCAD is installed.

**3.Create a Building:**

- Select the rectangular box according to your design requirement and click on wall icon.

- Give the dimensions to the wall like thickness (300mm) and height (3000mm).

**4.Add Structures:**

- Add structure elements like slabs, and roofs using the BIM tools.

**5.Add Windows and Doors:**

- Insert window (1000mm x 1000mm) and door (900mm x 2100mm) objects into the openings created earlier.

**6.Add Floor:**

- Insert floor of L= 5000mm, B=4000mm, H=200mm.

**7.Add HEB 180 girders:**

- Insert HEB 180 girders of height(200mm) and length(4000mm) on the upper walls and spaced according to the requirements.

**8.Add Slab:**

- Insert slab of L= 5000mm, B=4000mm, H=200mm.

**9.Export to IFC:**

- Export the BIM model to the IFC format for interoperability with other BIM software.

**10.Save Your Drawing:**

- Once you are satisfied with your basement slab plan, save your drawing file to your computer.

**11.Export or Print:**

- Depending on your requirements, you can export your drawing to various file formats or print it directly from LibreCAD for documentation or sharing purposes.

## * Result

- [3D Hut](<a href="https://ibb.co/x2kD8hj"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YNC3T2k/Screenshot-2024-04-29-235327.png" alt="Screenshot-2024-04-29-235327" border="0"></a>)
